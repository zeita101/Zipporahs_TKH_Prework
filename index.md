<h1>Zipporah Najar</h1>
<p><b>Why are you interested in becoming a TKH Innovation Fellow?</b></p>
<p> I enjoy storytelling, graphic design, playing instruments, research and writing. One of my hobbies is learning. I spend a lot of my time online learning from courses in various categories and in-person at workshops, seminars, and conferences. A lot of my free time also goes to volunteering for organizations like 365 SOUL & The Salvation Army. 
My future goals are to potentially start a career with the web development experience I will receive at The Knowledge House. 
I can add my natural curiosity and gifts for encouragement & team building to the classroom. </p>

<p>My goal for 2020 is to complete The Knowledge House Innovation Fellowship with excellence and full understanding of Web Development and to land an entry level job at a high paying tech company within 3 months of the completion of the program; and eventually implement my dream program, Engineers In Residence.</p>
